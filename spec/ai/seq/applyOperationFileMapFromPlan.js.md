# applyOperationFileMapFromPlan.js

This module exports a single function `applyOperationFileMapFromPlan` that takes an operation file map and applies the operations to the corresponding files.

## Function Signature

```javascript
async function applyOperationFileMapFromPlan(operationFileMap: Record<string, string>): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

- `operationFileMap`: A record where the keys are file paths and the values are the operations to be applied to the files.

## Description

The function iterates through the keys of the `operationFileMap` and applies the corresponding operation to the file at the given path. The operations can be one of the following:

- "move": Moves the file to a new location.
- "delete": Deletes the file.
- "update": Updates the file with the new content.

## Dependencies

- `fs.promises`: Used for file system operations like reading, writing, and deleting files.
- `path`: Used for handling file paths.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const operationFileMap = {
  "src/oldFile.js": "delete",
  "src/newFile.js": "move:src/oldFile.js",
  "src/updateFile.js": "update:New content for the file",
};

await applyOperationFileMapFromPlan(operationFileMap);
```

In this example, the function will delete the file at "src/oldFile.js", move the file at "src/newFile.js" to "src/oldFile.js", and update the content of the file at "src/updateFile.js" with "New content for the file".
